## 1. Overview 🤔

Samwad the one-stop solution for parents to understand how their children spend their time on social media.

It is a parenting tool to bridge the communication gap between parents and children in their teenage by helping parents track the behavioral and personality changes as well as the mental health of their children.

Samwad helps you get insights into any social media chat, both personal and group, to understand what’s going on in their children’s lives. Using this information, parents can keep track of whether their kids are on the right path and take actionable steps just in case they are not.

[But why](https://www.demandsage.com/whatsapp-statistics/) only WhatsApp ![whatsapp (1)](https://github.com/shrujaig14/Samwad/assets/134779004/910f08d3-d6ba-4823-b33b-0ae3914255df) ?

India has the most WhatsApp users with a head count of 535.8 million and WhatsApp is one of the top 3 social media platforms where people spend most of their time.

Our idea is to use Natural language processing (NLP) and data analysis techniques to analyze the text chats and draw relevant insights out of it.

- The insights that you can get from the prototype include total messages, links, and media shared. 


- The monthly timeline and weekly activity map can help you understand how actively is your kid talking to someone online whereas the daily timeline gives you insights about when is your child talking to them.

- With this, you can keep a check on how much time your child spends on WhatsApp and whether he is using WhatsApp in odd hours like late at night.

- The word cloud, most common words, and emoji analysis can help you understand the tonality of a conversation to get insights into his behavior and personality changes.




## 2. Purpose 🔥

The teenage years of a child are like an era of self-discovery, fueled by hormones where children have that immense urge to explore and question everything. You won’t find any parent taking a back seat during this tumultuous period of adolescence.

According to a study from 2016-2019, done on children aged 3-17 years, Around 9.4% (approx 5.8 million) had anxiety, 8.9% (approx 5.5 million) suffered from behavior problems and around 4,4% (approx 2.7 million) had depression.

The same study shows that among children aged 3-17 years in 2016, having another mental disorder was most common in children with depression: about 3 in 4 children with depression also had anxiety (73.8%) and almost 1 in 2 had behavior problems (47.2%) 

Shocking right?

But what is even more shocking is that most of the time parents are unaware of the mental health of their children. Also, they are unaware of almost everything happening in their children’s lives. A major reason behind this is the communication gap between parents and their children.

In such cases, parents end up having no control over their children. They have no idea about who, what, when, and how their kids interact with people on social media.

This unawareness is the root cause of a lot of behavioral and personality changes, and mental disorders in children which could have otherwise been treated, had the parents known about it.

## Usage Guidelines 📝

We have recorded a video of the complete walkthrough of our project. [Click here]() to watch the video.

To analyze the whatsapp chats, we need to first export the chats (Make sure to export the chats without media). [Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c3bTkXp9gqg) video to understand how to export chats. Our version 1.0 works only with 24 hour clock with the following date time format:-

(We are actively working on creating a generalized version of the date and time.)
